# Week 8 Quzi

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Imaging Technique
For my project, I chose to present Claude Monet's painting ''Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule'' through code. I wanted to use the imaging technique of **Line Abstraction** in my design, a style that would present the painting through lines and blocks of colour.

I was inspired by the following abstractionist paintings.

### Contribution to the Project
These abstract paintings create a strong visual and emotional effect through the balance of simple lines and colours. I wanted to add this feature to the design. For this project, I think line Abstraction would be better at adding interaction and animation features. line Abstraction would bring more clarity and dynamism to the interaction and animation effects.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Coding Technique and Effectiveness
I'm hoping to go through **p5.js** to complete my design.
p5.js works very well for my design. I can do the line abstraction of ''Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule'' with p5.js. I plan to abstract the outline of the artwork into lines first, and then do the rendering of the painting with the line and shape code. Then I plan to design the interactive functions and animations by using line and shape code, and by using sound or input code.
